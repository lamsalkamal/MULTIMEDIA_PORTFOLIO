	<h1>1. Responsive Web Design</h1>
		<h3>Why RWD?</h3>
			<p>Responsive Web Design is a concept where web pages primarily targeted to computer screens are responsive to be viewed from all media devices with variying screen sizes. Since most of the web traffic now originates from smartphones and other smart devices, it is very important to make websites easily viewable in those small screened devices.<br> Responsive Web Design aims to make websites automatically adapt the content presentation according to the screen size of the device being used to view the webpage. For example: smartphone users don´t have to zoom in to see the content and don´t have to scroll horizontally. The font size and images used also adapt accordingly making overall experience smooth.

		<h3>@media queries</h3>
			<p>
			"@media" queries in css3 can check the device properties and help apply different styles making the webapage responsive. 
			</p>
		<h3>Why use em</h3>
			<p>
			em in styling depends on the font and specifies the font size. Sizes like margins and paddings expressed in em means they will be displayed in proportion in all device sizes.
