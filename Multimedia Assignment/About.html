    <h2> My Experience During Studies</h2>
    <p> The course was quite  familiar and quite challenging to me. First few lecture were easy but later on it was abit complex for me. coding convention, web socket and retrieving  ajax data afrom the server was difficult part. </p>
    <h2> Phase 1 </h2>
    <p> The First exercise was fairly easy and there was no any problem for doing the tasks. Responsive web design was fun part to do.

    <h2>Phase 2</h2>
    <p> The second phase was a little difficult. I found little bit complex about the web socket. it was a new topic for myself but manage to do the things later on.

    <h2>Phase 3</h2>
        <p> The last phase was failry diificult to do. I had study canvas earlier but i was not able to make the games. Lastly, AJAX and flickr part gave some trouble but managed to do the things after spenting more time to them.</p>
